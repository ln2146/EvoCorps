2026-01-30 23:22:30,595 - INFO - 💬 👑 Leader comment 1 on post post-f053ef: I understand the concern, but the article's claim of "mass surveillance" seems like a significant overstatement based on the stated purpose of Purdue's health checks. Consider the practicalities: a secret database of student DNA would be a massive undertaking, logistically and financially. What specific, verifiable evidence supports the claim that this data is being secretly transferred and stored indefinitely, rather than used solely for immediate health monitoring purposes? If the goal is surveillance, wouldn't less invasive and more readily available methods be far more efficient? Focus on verifiable facts before accepting extreme claims.

2026-01-30 23:22:30,595 - INFO - 💬 👑 Leader comment 2 on post post-f053ef: It's easy to feel scared when we hear about things like DNA and government databases. I understand that feeling. But I hope we can all take a moment to think about the intention behind these health checks. Imagine a community where we could catch potential health issues early, protecting not only ourselves but also our loved ones. We all want a healthy and safe environment for our families. While the fear of privacy violations is valid, remember those working on these programs likely share that same desire for safety and have implemented safeguards. Let's approach this with open minds and ask questions to understand, rather than immediately assuming the worst. Maybe then, we can find a path forward that respects both our health and our privacy.
